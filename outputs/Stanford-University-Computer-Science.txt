### ADMISSIONS STRATEGY

* **Profile Evaluation:**
	+ The user's CGPA of 9.7/10 from Delhi University is highly competitive and meets the minimum GPA expectations.
	+ The user's background in Computer Science from a reputable university in India is a strong foundation for the Master's program.
	+ However, the admissions committee will also consider other factors such as research experience, work experience, and projects.
* **Strategic Gaps:**
	+ Research Experience: The user may benefit from participating in research projects or internships to demonstrate their ability to apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems.
	+ Work Experience: While not required, having some work experience in the field can be beneficial in demonstrating practical skills and industry knowledge.
	+ Projects: The user should highlight any personal projects or contributions to open-source projects that demonstrate their programming skills and interests.
* **Actionable Roadmap (Next 6 months):**
	1. **Month 1-2:**
		- Prepare for and take the GRE (aim for scores: 170-180 Verbal, 170-180 Quantitative)
		- Take the TOEFL (aim for a score: 100 or higher)
		- Research and finalize the list of recommenders for the application
	2. **Month 3-4:**
		- Participate in research projects or internships to gain practical experience
		- Contribute to open-source projects or develop personal projects to demonstrate programming skills
		- Draft and finalize the statement of purpose and personal statement
	3. **Month 5-6:**
		- Finalize the application and submit it by the early deadline (December 1)
		- Ensure all required documents, including transcripts and letters of recommendation, are submitted on time

By following this roadmap, the user can strengthen their application and increase their chances of being accepted into the Stanford University Master's in Computer Science program.
